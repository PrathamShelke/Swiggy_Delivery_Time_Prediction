Steps
1)Performed Basic Data Exploration and Cleaned the Data
2)Using Data Cleaning Code in the notebook 01 created data_clean_utils.py file and created swiggy_cleaned.csv
3)Performed EDA in 02 notebook to understand data properly by performing univariate,bivariate and multivariate analysis.

4)Building Baseline Model(Linear Regression,RandomForest) using 2 ways without Missing Val(NAN) and Imputation of missing vals
Evaluating both the Baseline model with metrics like MAE,R2 Score.

Through this Process of Baseline Model we found out that RandomForest is Good Baseline Model.

5)This experiments below is performed using MLflow+Dagshub which are used for model registry,experiment tracking,etc.

Performed EXP1: Where we will use RandomForest in 2 ways without Missing Values and Imputation of Missing Vals.

Performed EXP2:Where we use RandomForest with Imputation and adding Missing Indicator
